## Setup

**Setup - Local Install:**

If you are planning to make modifications to this project or you would like to access it
before it has been indexed on `PyPi`. I would recommend you either install this project
in `editable` mode or do a `local install`. For those of you, who want to make modifications
to this project. I would recommend you install the library in `editable` mode.

If you want to install the library in `editable` mode, make sure to run the `setup.py`
file, so you can install any dependencies you may need. To run the `setup.py` file,
run the following command in your terminal.

```console
pip install -e .
```

If you don't plan to make any modifications to the project but still want to use it across
your different projects, then do a local install.

```console
pip install .
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `setup.py` file. Once done
you can use the library wherever you want.
