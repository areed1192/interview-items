    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will go over how to parse SEC filing documents so you can extract different content from it and also logically organize the information. Making additional parsing more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it's safe to say that there is a remarkable amount of data available to individuals who seek high-quality financial data across a multitude of companies. This data can be used in a range of activities, from competition analysis to sentiment analysis. All it requires the individual to do is define a company they want, filing that belongs to that company, and the file that contains the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we've defined a few ways to search for information depending on the type of search you want to conduct:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broad Search:**\n",
    "    - You don't care what is returned, and you want all the filings for a given period. This search is best acheived by parsing the different index directories. These directories list all the filings made for a given period. While probably the most simple to wrap your head around, this returned the most significant amount of data. Making data management a priority.\n",
    "2. **Company Specific Search:**\n",
    "    - You are looking for a specific company and all their filings. There are currently two ways of doing this, using the CIK method or EDGAR Search Method. If you used the CIK method, you followed a technique that was similar to the Broad search method. Instead of looking at a specific period, you provide the CIK number, which will take you to a directory that contains all the filings that the company has made. Inside each filing folder, you would find all the files for that particular filing. If you didn't know the CIK number, you looked it up and did the CIK method. If you didn't know the CIK number you leveraged the EDGAR Search Method. Using this strategy meant requesting a URL that would direct you to a table containing all the filings for that company. However, this method required us to make a more complex script that would parse XML strings, paginating if the company had multiple pages, and reconstructing links to other directories.\n",
    "3. **Filing Specific Search:**\n",
    "    - Here you want only a specific filing for a particular company. Again this can be achieved either using the CIK Search Method or the EDGAR Search Method. It solely depends on whether you have the information upfront or not. The only additional piece of information you needed was the accession number.\n",
    "4. **Criteria Specific Search:**\n",
    "    - Here you were looking for a filing that has specific criteria, like the form being a 10K, a particular SIC number, or a particular date. This could only be achieved using the EDGAR Search Method, where you built a URL that contains the criteria you were searching on. In this case, your search was relatively simple because you only provided one rule. This search returns either an HTML or XML version of the data, which you would then have to parse.\n",
    "5. **Multi-Criteria Search:**\n",
    "    - This is similar to a form specific search, but instead of only having one criterion, you were searching on multiple criteria. The only difference here is you had to build and request a URL that contained multiple parameters. Once you got the data, it was parsed the same.\n",
    "6. **Text Search:**\n",
    "    - This type of search was done if you wanted to search on information found in the HEADER file for each filing. This allowed us to do the most complex searches as we could use boolean operators, wildcards, stemming, the order of evaluation, and phrase searching. While a powerful tool that allowed your searches to become very customized, it did require a decent working knowledge of both the HEADER file and search functionality. This was challenging as documentation is limited, requiring a fair amount of experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your particular search method, each can give you access to filings that match the criteria you specified. Once you've landed on the filing, you want to scrape. You can begin the process of extracting the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "Surprisingly, we don't need that many libraries to scrape the SEC filing. In this particular tutorial, we will use the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BeautifulSoup - This will be used to parse the actual text file content.\n",
    "2. Requests - This will be used to request the text file from the URL provided.\n",
    "3. Unicodedata - The text that is sent back is messy and will need to be cleaned up. We can use unicodedata to do that.\n",
    "4. Re - This is the RegEx library for python and will make looking for keywords smooth and quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your specific needs, you may need extra libraries but at this point, for simplicity, we will keep it to these four."

    "The text is a mess, so we will need to normalize it. However, we can't rely on just the `unicodedata` library to help us. Some `windows_1252_characters` will provide some challenges. I found a solution on Stack Overflow that'll help us normalize the remaining portions of the data. All this function does is take a string, finds any qualifying matches, decodes those matches, and then replaces them in the string. In essence, it's just cleaning up the characters that weren't decoded by the unicodedata library."

I take the URL, request the content using a `GET` request, store the response in a variable called `response`, and then pass through the content into our BeautifulSoup parser object. Make sure to specify the `lxml` parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Old Vs. New\n",
    "This is an excellent time to mention document structure and how structure changes depending on the filing's age. In newer filings, the HTML code is very well structured, meaning the tags are correct and allow us to go into extraordinary detail when we parse the info. In older filings, the HTML code is not well strucutred. To give you an idea of what you'll encounter, entire content will b stored in tags called `<PAGE>` and tables that don't have normal `td` and `tr` elements. This is just listing a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the scraping strategy we leverage will depend on the age of the filing. Additionally, I can't say with confidence at what point in time a filing is considered \"old\" as I haven't explored enough filings to find a pattern. I'm assuming most of us don't need to go far back in time to collect data, so this series focuses on the \"newer\" filings. In other words, those filings that have will define HTML code inside the text file.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason I mention this is because it helps you understand that some of the info exists deep in the document hierarchy. To get this info means traversing the hierarchy, in some cases, multiple times for each document in a filing. Continuing, a `document` has another hierarchy:\n",

    "3. filename\n",

    "In the code I present below, I try to maintain the hierarchy as much as possible — no sense of wasting something that is already there.

The challenging thing about parsing documents is it's easy to get lost early on. My advice to you is to keep it simple, keep it organized, and keep it clean. Most importantly, keep it organized!\n",

In other cases, you might want to dump your results in a text file.\n",
